        This question provides candidates with an opportunity demonstrate their skills and experience building web applications.
        The exercise allows candidates to apply their knowledge of front-end technologies and demonstrate their approach to solving problems.
        Candidates can choose between two flavors of this exercise to suit their experience: React or Vanilla (i.e. no JS framework).

    <h2>
        The Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
        Build a twitter clone (simplified).
    </p>
    <img src="react-tweets/screenshots/mockup%20-%20twitter%20list%20wireframe%20animation.gif" alt="Tweet list wireframe animation"/>

    <h2>
        Features & Requirements
    </h2>

    <p>
        Users of this app should be able to:
        <ul>
          <li>Add a tweet to a list (using canned ipsem lorem text)</li>
          <li>Remove the last tweet from the list</li>
          <li>(Optional) expand tweets to show tweets longer than 160 chars. This feature doesn't require a significantly different implementation approach from the above features, so can be skipped if time is short. </li>
        </ul>

        The app should:
        <ul>
          <li>only present the remove button when there are tweets to remove</li>
          <li>be styled to match the following high-fidelity mockup</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
